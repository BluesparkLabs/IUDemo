# Services configuration overrides for the frontend developer environments.
#
# Instructions for use:
#
# - Copy example.settings.local.php to sites/default/settings.local.php
# - Ensure both "local development services" as well as
#   "frontend development services" are enabled in settings.local.php

parameters:
  twig.config:
    #
    # Twig debugging is enabled for frontend developers so that:
    #
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    # check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    # should be set to FALSE.
    #
    # For more information about debugging Twig templates, see
    # https://www.drupal.org/node/1906392.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default false
    debug: true
    #
    # Twig auto-reload:
    #
    # Automatically recompile Twig templates whenever the source code changes.
    # If you don't provide a value for auto_reload, it will be determined
    # based on the value of debug.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default null
    auto_reload: null
    #
    # Twig cache:
    #
    # Warning, Disabling the Twig cache to recompile the templates from source
    # each time they are used. In most cases the auto_reload setting above
    # should be enabled rather than disabling the Twig cache.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default true
    cache: true
  #
  # Cacheability debugging:
  #
  # Responses with cacheability metadata (CacheableResponseInterface instances)
  # get X-Drupal-Cache-Tags and X-Drupal-Cache-Contexts headers.
  #
  # For more information about debugging cacheable responses, see
  # https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/response/cacheable-response-interface
  #
  # Not recommended in production environments
  # @default false
